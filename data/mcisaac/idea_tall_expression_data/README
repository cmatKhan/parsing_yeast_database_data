downloaded the "raw & processed gene expression data"
from the link below on 20231116

https://idea.research.calicolabs.com/data

the file is called: idea_tall_expression_data.tsv

I xz compressed this file and then split it into
parts no larger than 50MB to store on github.

to re-create the original, uncompressed file, do
the following:

cat xa* | xz -d > idea_tall_expression_data.tsv
