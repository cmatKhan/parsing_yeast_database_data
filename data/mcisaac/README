Quoted from their website:

```raw
For each of 10.4M gene expression observations, raw and progressively processed forms of the data are provided. The data are presented as a single tall-format table, with one observation per row.

Variables are:

    TF — induced transcriptional regulator
    strain — strain name
    date - date performed
    restriction - nutrient limitation
    mechanism - GEV vs ZEV induction system
    time - time point (minutes)
    GeneName gene names
    green_median - median of green (reference) channel fluorescence
    red_median - median of red (experimental) channel fluorescence
    log2_ratio - log2(red / green) subtracting value at time zero
    log2_cleaned_ratio - Non-specific stress response and prominent outliers removed
    log2_noise_model - estimated noise standard deviation
    log2_cleaned_ratio_zth2d - cleaned timecourses hard-thresholded based on multiple observations (or last observation) passing the noise model
    log2_selected_timecourses - cleaned timecourses hard-thresholded based on single observations passing noise model and impulse evaluation of biological feasibility
    log2_shrunken_timecourses - selected timecourses with observation-level shrinkage based on local FDR (false discovery rate). Most users of the data will want to use this column.
