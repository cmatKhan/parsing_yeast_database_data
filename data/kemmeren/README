## Original data

[deleteome_all_mutants_ex_wt_var_controls.txt]
Tab-delimited file that contains both the M ratios (mutant/wildtype), A values
and p values for all deletion mutants obtained through the limma statistical
modeling approach. In addition, three control experiments, matA versus
matAlpha, YPD versus SC and BY4343 versus BY4342 (diploid versus haploid) have
been added for easier comparison to external datasets. The first two rows
contain the name and data type (M, A or p value) for each experiment. The first
three columns contain the reporterId, systematic name (ORF name) and standard
gene symbol for every gene present on the DNA microarray. Wildtype variable
genes (for details see Supplemental Methods) have been excluded from this
dataset.

[deleteome_all_mutants_controls.txt]
Same as the above, except that the wildtype variable genes are not excluded.

## Gene expression-profiles of all mutants - slow growth signature removed

[deleteome_all_mutants_svd_transformed.txt]
Transformed gene expression changes of all deletion mutants. Any similarity to
the slow growth profile has been removed by subtracting the first SVD mode from
the original data. Rows are transcripts, named by their systematic name,
columns are gene deletion mutants, named by the common name of the gene that
was deleted. Values are M values, that is, the log2(deletion mutant / wild
type). For details see "Cell cycle population effects in perturbation studies",
